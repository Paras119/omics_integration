the code starts by the import of library - cobra and reframed.FBA and reframed.load_cbmodel
it follows the procedure to import the organism metabolic model in cbmodel format, cobra.load_sbml does work here due to the different formats, one used for the function is the cbodel format.

perform gimme algorithm

define the solver to perform FBA of the created model.

FBA function always crashes the kernel, maybe to the limitations in the computational power of the system
